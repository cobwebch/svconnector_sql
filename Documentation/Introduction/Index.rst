Introduction
------------

This extension implements a specific connector service for reading
data from any database. With TYPO3 v7, it relies on ADODB to connect to any
database system supported by that library (with some limits,
due to the many weird syntaxes used for some systems).
With TYPO3 v8, it relies on Doctrine DBAL, which comes with a better
unified way of defining connection parameters.
SQL queries can then be used.
