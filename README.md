# Connector service - SQL

This service relies on the database abstraction layer provided by TYPO3
(Doctrine DBAL) to access any supported, remote DBMS,
execute SELECT queries and return their result as a PHP array or an XML structure.

Read the manual for more details: https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/svconnector_sql/
